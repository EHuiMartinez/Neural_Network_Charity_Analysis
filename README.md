# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for AlphabetSoup.


## Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
3. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
